# Project Summary: Personal Website Development for Andrew Yen

**Objective:**
Develop a personal website to showcase Andrew Yen's professional profile, projects, and contact information, while integrating features such as a weather app, donation form, and downloadable resources.

## Difficulties:

- **Responsive Design:** Creating a responsive design that looks good on various devices was challenging. Ensuring the navbar, carousel, and other elements adapted smoothly required careful use of Bootstrap's grid system and CSS media queries.

- **Data Integration:** Integrating real-time weather data and ensuring the correct functionality of the donation form posed a challenge. Fetching and displaying data dynamically while maintaining performance and responsiveness was critical.

- **API Integration:** Setting up API calls for real-time weather updates and handling potential errors or unexpected responses from the API were complex tasks. Ensuring the API keys were securely managed was also a concern.

- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Ensuring the website functioned and appeared consistently across different browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) required thorough testing and debugging, as some features behaved differently across browsers.

- **User Interaction and Experience:** Designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for users to navigate through the website, use the weather app, and complete the donation form was challenging. Balancing aesthetics with functionality took careful planning.

## Wins:

- **Seamless Navigation:** The use of Bootstrap enabled the creation of a professional and responsive navbar that facilitated smooth navigation. The collapsible menu worked well on both desktop and mobile devices.

- **Engaging Visuals:** The carousel feature added visual appeal and effectively highlighted key messages and links. It provided an engaging way to present Andrew Yen's profile and projects.

- **Functional Weather App:** Successfully integrated a weather app that fetched real-time data based on user input. This feature enhanced the website's interactivity and usefulness.

- **Enhanced Interactivity:** The inclusion of interactive elements, such as the search functionality and contact form, improved the overall user experience. These features provided users with multiple ways to interact with the website.

- **Smooth Performance:** Despite the various features, the website maintained good performance and responsiveness. Optimizing scripts and stylesheets contributed to fast load times and a smooth user experience.

## Conclusion

The project successfully created an engaging and functional personal website for Andrew Yen. Overcoming the challenges of responsive design, data integration, and user interaction resulted in a polished and interactive platform. The wins achieved demonstrate the effectiveness of using modern web development technologies and practices.
